# Getting started

Welcome to LinkedPipes Applications backend documentation!

This documentation is intented for developers looking for references about backend implementation of the platform as
well as details on code structure, and architecture of a backend service.

## For developers

The following set of tutorials is intented for developers aiming to:

- Work on contributing into our **Backend** implementation of **LinkedPipes Applications** platform.
- Work on their own forked version, extend or expand the backend service for their own use-cases.
- Simply look for a reference documentation and **javadoc**.

This documentation also assumes that developer is familiar with general concepts of `Semantic Web`, `LinkedData` and
is familiar with general definitions of other components used by or implemented by LinkedPipes Appplications platform
such as [Discovery](https://github.com/linkedpipes/discovery), [ETL](https://etl.linkedpipes.com),
[LinkedPipes Applications Frontend](http://docs.frontend.applications.linkedpipes.com),
[Virtuoso](http://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## What's next?

Start from [Installation](<{{link('Installation')}}>) chapter for details and various installation options. Consecutive
chapters dive deeper into providing details on backend component overview, architecture and discovery configurations.
In addition to that, you always refer to **javadoc** section for more low-level implementation details.
If you would like to learn more on how to interact with the running backend instance, refer to [Backend API Documentation](https://linkedpipes.docs.apiary.io).
