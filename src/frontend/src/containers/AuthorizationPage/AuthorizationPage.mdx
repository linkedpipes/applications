# AuthorizationPage

AuthorizationPage is a container representing a `AuthorizationPage` webpage.

# Main funcionality

- Selecting SOLID `Provider` for authentication.
- Switching between login by `Provider` and login by `WebID`.
- Redirecting user to SOLID authentication pane.

# Structure

`AuthorizationPage` component exported from `AuthorizationPage` folder is represented by a stateless react component and a react `PureComponent` serving as a container.

```.md
├── AuthorizationComponent.jsx # Stateless react component, responsible for ui
├── AuthorizationContainer.jsx # React PureComponent, responsible for both UI and states
├── AuthorizationPage.mdx # Documentation markdown that you are currently looking at
├── children/ # Children components used within 'AuthorizationComponent.jsx'
└── index.js
```
